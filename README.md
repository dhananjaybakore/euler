# Solutions to Euler Problems
####Problem 1:
- See Problem1.java
- Algorithm: You just need to add multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtract multiples of 15 once, this ensures that you have up to 40% less calulations and you avoid using the % operater.

####Problem 2
- See Problem2.java
- Simple linear algorithm, just generate fib numbers iteratively(Tail Recursive) and keep on adding the even ones to generate the result.
